    :description: Instructions for flashing and configuring IWOOLE Table Lamps.

The IWOOLE Table Lamp is a RGBW lamp normally configured using the Tuya Smart App.
It is available from various retailers online or directly from `iwoole.com <https://www.iwoole.com/product/category/wifi-smart-table-lamp/>`__.

1. Device overview
------------------
.. note::
    The following information relates to the desk model depicted above. There are free-standing and a desk version with a longer arm versions available. They are likely to share the same internals and configuration, but it is not certain. 

The device is a basic 4-channel PWM RGBW light in a simple housing.
The LEDs are not individually addressable.
No other sensors, outputs or status leds are available.

The mosfets for the different color channels are connected as follows:

- GPIO04: White
- GPIO12: Green
- GPIO13: Blue
- GPIO14: Red

2. ESPHome configuration
------------------------
Since there is only one RGBW light to configure the .yaml file is fairly straightforward.
Alternatively, you could configure each channel as a separate light if desired.
I prefer to use the ``color_interlock`` config option along with the configuration below. 

2.1 Example configuration
*************************
.. code-block:: yaml

    esphome:
      name: "IWOOLE Table Lamp"
      #ESP type is ESP8266EX with 1MB flash
      platform: ESP8266
      board: esp01_1m


    # Standard configuration
    wifi:
      ssid: "yourwifinetwork"
      password: "iamverysecure"
      ap:
        ssid: "IWOOLE Table Lamp Fallback Hotspot"
        password: "safefallbackpassword"
    captive_portal:
    logger:
    api:
      password: "ialwaysforgetthisone"
    ota:
      password: "enteryourownpasswordhere"


    # Start of device specific configuration
    light:
      - platform: rgbw
        name: "Light"
        red: output_red
        green: output_green
        blue: output_blue
        white: output_white

    output:
      - platform: esp8266_pwm
        id: output_red
        pin: GPIO14
      - platform: esp8266_pwm
        id: output_green
        pin: GPIO12
      - platform: esp8266_pwm
        id: output_blue
        pin: GPIO13
      - platform: esp8266_pwm
        id: output_white
        pin: GPIO4

3. Flashing
-----------
There are two ways to get ESPHome onto this device.

3.1 Tuya-convert
***********
.. note::
    According to `blakadder.com <https://templates.blakadder.com/iwoole_table_lamp.html>`__ if you connect the device to the tuya smart app the firmware will upgrade and the device will not be flashable via this method anymore! 

Flashing 3 times

3.2 Serial connection
*********************
.. warning::
    The circuit inside will be exposed to mains voltage. Do not connect your device to the mains when flashing. Flashing this device via a serial connection will involve soldering and cutting through insulating heat-shrink tubing which will have to be replaced. If you are uncomfortable with this, or are not confident around mains voltage, do not attempt to do this! Using the Tuya-convert method is preferred.

1. Disconnect the device from mains voltage!
2. Open the device. The plastic and aluminium halves can be separated by twisting the plastic part counter-clockwise DOUBLECHECK!
3. Remove the two screws holding the round plate with the LEDs. It is connected to the main PCB with a little cable. Make note of the orientation of this connection to ensure you reconnect it correctly later.
4. Carefully remove the heat-shrink tubing around the two main PCBs.
5. Solder the following wires onto the PCB
